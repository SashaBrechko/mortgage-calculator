<h5>• Add bank</h5>
On this tab, you can add a new bank to the list. <br>
Fill in all the fields to do that (you can see help info on the right side). <br>
After clicking the "Save" button you automatically go to the "My banks" tab. 
The bank you just added is on the top of the list.

<h5>• My banks</h5>
Here you can see all the banks you added with their conditions. <br>
There is a "Remove all" button above the list. Press it to delete all the banks from the list. <br>
Three buttons are located below each bank:
<br> - ✏️ (Edit) -> you can edit bank information and save changes;
<br> - 🗑️ (Delete) -> this button lets you remove a bank from the list;
<br> - ✔️ (Choose bank) -> click this button to choose the bank and attach it to the Calculator.

<h5>• Calculator</h5>
This page is to calculate the monthly payment on your mortgage based on the bank conditions and your entered data.
